<p> Webdav is known as Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning is an extension to HTTP that lets clients edit remote content on the web. In essence, it enables a web server to act as a file server, allowing authors to collaborate on web content.
WebDAV enriches the standard set of HTTP headers and methods to let you create, move, edit files and delete or copy files and folders. WebDAV dates back to the late 90s; in internet years, it is considered ancient. In the world of web protocols and APIs it predates both SOAP/XML and RESTful architectures. Despite its longevity, WebDAV implementations can be quirky. Many servers and clients implement subsets or extended subsets of the multiple standards involved.

<p>In 1996, Jim whitehead, a doctorate degree graduate from The University of California, decided to overcome the limitation of just read-only webpages. 
He organized a meeting with members of the World Wide Web Consortium to discuss the problem of authoring on the web. </p>
<p>The protocol was first defined in RFC 2518 and did not include versioning because it was thought that doing both would be too much work. The work was split between two work groups and the Delta-V protocol, an extension for WebDAV, was defined in 2002 with RFC 3253. Finally, WebDAV was updated with RFC 4918 in 2007.

<p> Pros

    You are interested in a more secure method for transferring files since FTP is not secure.
    WebDAV does not require you to open multiple ports for the file transfer.
    File locking is common with WebDAV, whereas other methods do not have this feature.
    You would like to map your storage as a network drive by using systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux.
    You want your users to collaborate by editing and managing files on the server
</p>
<p> Cons

    You are looking for the most efficient method for transferring files. This would be done by using FTP.
    Some hosts do not support WebDAV at all.
    WebDAV has been known to be rather slow compared to other alternatives. It is also not the best when it comes to memory usage.

<p> Different types of WebDav servers</p>

<p>General Purpose Webservers-The default open source WebDAV implementation is in the Apache HTTP Server. Many webservers support WebDAV via an add-on module, such as Nginx, lighttpd, and Microsoft IIS.</p>

<p>-Version Control Systems-Several version control systems are accessible via some form of WebDAV, including Subversion, Git, and PVCS.
Collaborative Platforms and Content Management Systems.</p>

<p>Collaboration platforms like Microsoft Sharepoint, or CMSs like WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla may have WebDAV built-in or available via add-on modules.
Network-Attached Storage and Cloud storage services.</p>

<p>Network-Attached Storage (NAS) devices on your LAN may support remote access via WebDAV. Cloud file hosting services like Box.com may offer you access to your folders and files via WebDAV.
Various applications</p>
