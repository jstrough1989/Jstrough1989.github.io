</header>

<section>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This meetUp group I was attending was hosted by Peter L. and SFHTML March 22, 2019. I attended from 5:00 -9:00 and 
  The purpose of this meetUp is for the idea that developers stop worrying about server management and focus on code.
  If you'd like to learn more about serverless you can visit this webpage <a href=" https://serverless.com" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>At the end of the lecture, the instructor was explaining about their javaScript Bootcamp program along with detail
        information about the steps of the course programs and focus on the student success in getting tech jobs at the end of the course.
      The course takes about 9 months and did not explain about the fee of the course. The only fee I recall is the prep study to get into the programs. You have a choice to study for free or about $500 with supports.</p>
