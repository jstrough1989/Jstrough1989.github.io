<p> Stroughter Elementary is a welcoming community school committed to high quality instruction for all of our diverse students. Our goal is for all students to have access to high-quality learning, to develop positive relationships, to engage in curriculum designed with them at the center. We are deeply committed to providing our students a well-rounded education that involves access to science and inquiry, the arts, and opportunities for collaboration. Stroughter Elementary equips students with the knowledge, skills, and strength of character needed to succeed in college and serve as leaders in their communities.
</p>

<p> Our core belief is that all children can achieve at the highest levels regardless of background or circumstance when held to high academic and behavioral expectations. Our curriculum and environment will manifest the belief in high expectations for every child. “Hard work leads to success” will not just be seen and heard in every classroom and throughout the school building every day, school leaders, teachers, and students will bring these words to life in their intensive focus on learning and their continuous monitoring of academic progress.<p>
